            <p>
              At Tealford Consulting, our website creation process begins with a free, no-pressure consultation where we get to know your brand, goals, and style preferences. During this session, we walk you through examples of our previous work and explore design directions that align with your vision. Once we understand your needs, we outline a plan and begin building a working prototype tailored specifically for your project. This gives you a clear idea of how your site will look and function before any major steps are taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the prototype is approved, we’ll set up everything needed to bring your website to life. This includes creating any necessary accounts for hosting and site management—handled entirely on your behalf. Once your website is live, we’ll walk you through how to access and manage it confidently. You'll receive simple, clear training on how to make updates and maintain your site over time. And even after we’ve handed over your custom code, we’re still here—offering support and guidance to ensure your site remains stable, effective, and truly yours.
